# The Legends of Zelda: Skulls of Darkness

My name is Dev Saravanan, and this is my final project for the CS50X course at Harvard University via edX. This is a custom ripoff of the Legends of Zelda game. You can move around with WASD, click to attack enemies (skulls). They drop rupees upon death, which can be used to purchase health or atk boost potions (new update). More info in my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3yiuo4QFe4. I am also making this completely open-source, just make sure to give me credit if you use it.

Note, you do need [LOVE2D](https://www.love2d.org/) to operate this, their software is amazing. put in the "love.exe" file in the folder once you unzip it, and you should be good to go.
