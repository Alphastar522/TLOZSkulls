# The Legends of Zelda: Skulls of Darkness

My name is Dev Saravanan, and this is my final project for the CS50X course at Harvard University via edX. This is a custom ripoff of the Legends of Zelda game. You can move around with WASD, click to attack enemies (skulls). They drop rupees upon death, which can be used to purchase health or atk boost potions (new update).
